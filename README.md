### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Run the command:  `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
